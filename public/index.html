                        <p>My name is Jiawen Huang. I&rsquo;m a third year PhD student working with <a href="http://www.chrisbaldassano.com/">Dr. Chris Baldassano</a> at the Department of Psychology at Columbia University. In my research, I use naturalistic paradigms to look at how our structured knowledge of the world (schema) help us understand and remember events happening around us. I&rsquo;m also interested in exploring ways to use various games to study memory.</p>
<p>I was born in Ningde, Fujian, China. I then moved to a few different cities in China growing up, including Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. I then moved to London and did my undergrad at UCL Psychology Department. I worked with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/david-shanks/">Dr. David Shanks</a> to study how making meta-cognitive judgements influences memory. After finishing my undergrad, I worked with <a href="http://www.lab-lab.org/">Dr. Jeremy Skipper</a> and helped build <a href="https://www.naturalistic-neuroimaging-database.org/">the NNDb</a>, where participants watched movies in fMRI scanner.</p>
<p>In my free time, I play a lot of video games on my PC and Switch. My favorite type of games are JRPGs, but I also play a lot of other random games. Thanks to my (and Chris&rsquo;s) research interest in developing methods to use games to study memory, I have an okay-ish excuse to play them.</p>

<p>When forming a memory of an experience that is unfolding over time, we can use our schematic knowledge about the world (constructed based on many prior episodes) to predict what will transpire. We developed a novel paradigm to study how the development of a complex schema influences predictive processes during perception and impacts sequential memory. Participants learned to play a novel board game (“4-in-a-row”) across six training sessions, and repeatedly performed a memory test in which they watched and recalled sequences of moves from the game. We found that participants gradually became better at remembering sequences from the game as their schema developed, driven by improved accuracy for schema-consistent moves. Eye tracking revealed that increased predictive eye movements during encoding, which were most prevalent in expert players, were associated with better memory. Our results identify prediction as a mechanism by which schematic knowledge can improve episodic memory.  <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/gej7q">[preprint]</a></p>

<h4 id="behind-the-scene" class="anchor-link"><a href="#behind-the-scene">Behind the Scene</a></h4>
<p>In my first year of grad school, Chris told me about this game that Weiji Ma&rsquo;s group developed. It&rsquo;s a simple board game called 4-in-a-row, where the objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own pieces on a 4x9 board. The game enabled people to develop a complex schema in a reasonable amount of time. Over the spring and summer of 2021, we conducted a 6-session longitudinal study online, and we found some interesting results to show how people gradually became better at remembering schema-consistent moves over time. In the start of my second year, I realized another interesting aspect of this game - that different spatial locations correspond to possible next moves. This allows us to get a behavioral measure of people&rsquo;s prediction by measuring their eye-movements. I was really excited about the idea, because I&rsquo;ve always felt like prediction has been mostly measured with behaviors. I was extremely busy, taking three classes and collecting fMRI data for my MoL study that semester and I was luck to have the help from Isabel, a post-bac student who joined our lab to get some required research hours for the program. She ended up collected &gt; 100 hours worth of eye-tracking data (with a extremely terrible experiment setup because there&rsquo;s a web version of the experiment working and I was too lazy to learn psychopy then). We found some cool results of how prediction develops as a result of schema development and how they&rsquo;re closely tight to the memory improvement.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re following up with two more studies to address different questions with this method, one with eye-tracking and one with fMRI+eye-tracking (in collaboration with Dr. Mariam Aly and Dr. Serra Favila). I&rsquo;m very excited about these projects.</p>

<p>In this ongoing study, we train a group of novices to learn the ancient technique called Method of Loci (aka. Memory Palace, Roman Room) and scan them 3 times over 4 weeks. Participants build a personal memory palace (a &lsquo;cognitive map&rsquo;) and come in to use it for remembering a list of words in fMRI scanner. We look at the representation when they&rsquo;re thinking about the words alone, the loci alone, and when they combine the two during encoding and retrieval. We also look at longitudinally how these representations change over time, how they compare to memory athletes who had the memory palace for years and have been using them a lot more than the novices.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging has advanced our understanding of human psychology using reductionist stimuli that often do not resemble information the brain naturally encounters. It has improved our understanding of the network organization of the brain mostly through analyses of ‘resting-state’ data for which the functions of networks cannot be verifiably labelled. We make a ‘Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database’ (NNDb v1.0) publically available to allow for a more complete understanding of the brain under more ecological conditions during which networks can be labelled. Eighty-six participants underwent behavioural testing and watched one of 10 full-length movies while functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. Resulting timeseries data are shown to be of high quality, with good signal-to-noise ratio, few outliers and low movement. Data-driven functional analyses provide further evidence of data quality. They also demonstrate accurate timeseries/movie alignment and how movie annotations might be used to label networks. The NNDb can be used to answer questions previously unaddressed with standard neuroimaging approaches, progressing our knowledge of how the brain works in the real world. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00680-2">[paper]</a> <a href="https://www.naturalistic-neuroimaging-database.org/">[database]</a></p>

<h4 id="behind-the-scene" class="anchor-link"><a href="#behind-the-scene">Behind the Scene</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by fMRI. When I first started undergrad I was afraid the crown on my teeth will be pull out by fMRI, so I never did anything with it. In my third year, I took a seminar called &ldquo;Language in Context&rdquo; taught by <a href="http://www.lab-lab.org/">Dr. Jeremy Skipper</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/david-vinson/">Dr. David Vinson</a>. The class was really cool for two reasons: 1. In the UK most of the psych classes are lectures and there are not really seminar classes that students can take where they read and discuss papers. So the format is really interesting 2. The premise of the class is to put the study of language back in the rich context, instad of breaking it down into smaller components. We discussed topics about how multimodal cues including mouth movements and gestures all help facilitate language understanding. I also learned about the idea of predictive coding in the class, which motivates much of my current work.</p>
<p>At the summer of 2019 after I finished undergrad, I started working in Jeremy&rsquo;s lab. Then I took the MRI safety training and found out that my teeth will not be pulled out by the scanner, so I started helping with a lot of data collections for the project, where different people watch different genres of movies (including the usual suspect, The Shawshank Redemption, The Prestige, Split, Pulp Fiction, Little Miss Sunshine, Citizenfour, Back to the Fuure, 500 Days of Summer	, 12 Years a Slave) in the scanner. Most movies have 8 participants each, but for 500 days of summer and citizen four, we have ~20 people. My other other contribution for the project incldues improving word annotation tools by combining movie subtitle and the aws transcript, and creating movie annotation and measurement of &ldquo;context&rdquo; using NLP and CV tools.</p>
