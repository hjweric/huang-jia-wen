##### Neural representation of memory during Method of Loci
In this ongoing study, we train a group of novices to learn the ancient technique called Method of Loci (aka. Memory Palace, Roman Room) and scan them 3 times over 4 weeks. Participants build a personal memory palace (a 'cognitive map') and come in to use it for remembering a list of words in fMRI scanner. We look at the representation when they're thinking about the words alone, the loci alone, and when they combine the two during encoding and retrieval. We also look at longitudinally how these representations change over time, how they compare to memory athletes who had the memory palace for years and have been using them a lot more than the novices.
