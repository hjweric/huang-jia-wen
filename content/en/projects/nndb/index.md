Scene from 500 days of summer, a movie that I really get to hate very much because I watched it so many times while scanning / working on some annotation of the project...

#### A naturalistic neuroimaging database for understanding the brain using ecological stimuli 

Neuroimaging has advanced our understanding of human psychology using reductionist stimuli that often do not resemble information the brain naturally encounters. It has improved our understanding of the network organization of the brain mostly through analyses of ‘resting-state’ data for which the functions of networks cannot be verifiably labelled. We make a ‘Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database’ (NNDb v1.0) publically available to allow for a more complete understanding of the brain under more ecological conditions during which networks can be labelled. Eighty-six participants underwent behavioural testing and watched one of 10 full-length movies while functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. Resulting timeseries data are shown to be of high quality, with good signal-to-noise ratio, few outliers and low movement. Data-driven functional analyses provide further evidence of data quality. They also demonstrate accurate timeseries/movie alignment and how movie annotations might be used to label networks. The NNDb can be used to answer questions previously unaddressed with standard neuroimaging approaches, progressing our knowledge of how the brain works in the real world.

#### Behind the Scene
I've always been fascinated by fMRI. When I first started undergrad I was afraid the crown on my teeth will be pull out by fMRI, so I never did anything with it. In my third year, I took a seminar called "Language in Context" taught by [Dr. Jeremy Skipper](http://www.lab-lab.org/) and [Dr. David Vinson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/david-vinson/). The class was really cool for two reasons: 1. In the UK most of the psych classes are lectures and there are not really seminar classes that students can take where they read and discuss papers. So the format is really interesting 2. The premise of the class is to put the study of language back in the rich context, instad of breaking it down into smaller components. We discussed topics about how multimodal cues including mouth movements and gestures all help facilitate language understanding. I also learned about the idea of predictive coding in the class, which motivates much of my current work. 

At the summer of 2019 after I finished undergrad, I started working in Jeremy's lab. Then I took the MRI safety training and found out that my teeth will not be pulled out by the scanner, so I started helping with a lot of data collections for the project, where different people watch different genres of movies (including the usual suspect, The Shawshank Redemption, The Prestige, Split, Pulp Fiction, Little Miss Sunshine, Citizenfour, Back to the Fuure, 500 Days of Summer	, 12 Years a Slave) in the scanner. Most movies have 8 participants each, but for 500 days of summer and citizen four, we have ~20 people. My other other contribution for the project incldues improving word annotation tools by combining movie subtitle and the aws transcript, and creating movie annotation and measurement of "context" using NLP and CV tools.
