My name is Jiawen Huang. I'm a third year PhD student working with [Dr. Chris Baldassano](http://www.chrisbaldassano.com/) at the Department of Psychology at Columbia University. In my research, I use naturalistic paradigms to look at how our structured knowledge of the world (schema) help us understand and remember events happening around us. I'm also interested in exploring ways to use various games to study memory.

I was born in Ningde, Fujian, China. I then moved to a few different cities in China growing up, including Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. I then moved to London and did my undergrad at UCL Psychology Department. I worked with [Dr. David Shanks](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/david-shanks/) to study how making meta-cognitive judgements influences memory. After finishing my undergrad, I worked with [Dr. Jeremy Skipper](http://www.lab-lab.org/) and helped build [the NNDb](https://www.naturalistic-neuroimaging-database.org/), where participants watched movies in fMRI scanner. 

In my free time, I play a lot of video games on my PC and Switch. My favorite type of games are JRPGs, but I also play a lot of other random games. Thanks to my (and Chris's) research interest in developing methods to use games to study memory, I have an okay-ish excuse to play them.
